# Load-Forecasting-for-New-Hampshire
This project focuses on developing a robust model for forecasting the hourly electricity load in New Hampshire for January 2023, utilizing the response variable "RT_Demand." The analysis relies on historical hourly data from the "2022 SMD Hourly Data," "2021 SMD Hourly Data," and "2020 SMD Hourly Data." Selected features, including Date, Hr_End, Dry_Bulb, and Dew_Point, are considered, with additional transformations such as squared terms and day-of-week variations. The exclusion of pricing-related information and data beyond January, 2023, maintains the project's focus on load forecasting. Leveraging advanced statistical and machine learning techniques, the model aims to provide crucial inputs for traders to anticipate hourly power prices, contributing to informed decision-making in the dynamic energy market. The project acknowledges limitations and outlines a structured timeline covering data pre-processing, feature engineering, model development, and validation. Ultimately, this undertaking seeks to enhance the efficiency of energy trading by delivering reliable hourly load forecasts for January2023.
